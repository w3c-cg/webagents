## Meeting Notes

General updates:

- Agent Toolkits 2025 last week at EUMAS 2025 in Bucharest: [https://interactions.ics.unisg.ch/agent-toolkits-2025/](https://interactions.ics.unisg.ch/agent-toolkits-2025/)

- HyperAgents 2025 coming up: [https://ecai2025.hyperagents.org](https://ecai2025.hyperagents.org)

- we intend to organize a f2f/hybrid meeting of the WebAgents CG

Updates from Jérémy:

- Agents and Web Services summary: [https://deploy-preview-95--w3cwebagentscg.netlify.app/#agents-and-web-services](https://deploy-preview-95--w3cwebagentscg.netlify.app/#agents-and-web-services) (Section 3.2.1)

- Agentic AI summary: [https://deploy-preview-94--w3cwebagentscg.netlify.app/#agentic-ai](https://deploy-preview-94--w3cwebagentscg.netlify.app/#agentic-ai) (Section 3.2.3)

[JL] Updated the terminology for Tools and Augmented Language Agents (now include Language Agents). I've also updated the protocol table.

[AC] I updated the definitions (Section 2), not yet pushed. A tool is not necessarily a Web resource in Agentic AI frameworks, so now there is another definition for "Web-based tool".

[TP] Web based tool is a web resource that is exposed through the web and thus has an interface. Think of it as a subclass of Tools.  These can include Web-Services.  Can be local or remote.

It can make use of natural language in addition to APIs.  Any tool that has a web interface fits this definition.  The description of the interface may not always be documented (?!) 

A key aspect of a tool (?)  is the natural language description.

Add an example to the Web-based Tool / Artifact Section to reference natural language descriptions of tools.

We discussed extensively about tools and artifacts vs. web-based tools and web-based artifacts. It was agreed that we need a higher-level note that terminology is not limited to its LLM interpretation.

JL: Should be linked to the binding templates document rather than TDs because the point is to use TD to integrate devices using non-Web protocols. Clarified by Ege: The Bindings Templates document is no longer to be used. The TD standard is the right reference.

TP: Discussed notion of environment vs world - environments are observable, while the world may include areas that are not observable.

AC: reviewed discussion around section 3.3: architectural considerations.  Mentioned design goals and then moved on to architectural considerations.

AC: Opened DW book on architecture for MAS. We discussed extensively the situated agent pattern and the virtual environment pattern. It is agreed to proceed with these patterns to bootstrap the section.
