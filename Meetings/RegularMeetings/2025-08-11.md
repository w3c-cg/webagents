We had a good discussion with WoT WG on Manageable Affordances. We'll follow through for updates.

Interoperability TF report in preparation. The report bridges the gap between the research community and the broader W3C community. The report defines the concepts used.

Discussion concerning the definitions.

Presentation of conceptual dimensions ([https://deploy-preview-88--w3cwebagentscg.netlify.app/)](https://deploy-preview-88--w3cwebagentscg.netlify.app/)). Andrei asks for feedback on the conceptual dimensions.

Discussion on open MAS and language agents in closed vs open MAS. Most applications of language/augmented language models are currently in closed systems, even when using protocols like MCP that can be used in open systems.

Discussion of the 5 stars of Linked Data as a path to move from closed MAS to open MAS.
