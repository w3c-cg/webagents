## Minutes

EK reviews the meeting notes from the previous meeting. DV to present current notes on profiles for the interop report.

Report version being discussed:

[https://deploy-preview-105--w3cwebagentscg.netlify.app/#profiles](https://deploy-preview-105--w3cwebagentscg.netlify.app/#profiles)

DV: I will present the approaches that have been collected so far. I give the definition first.

DV: Section 5 starts with a generic definition of profiles, which is aligned with previous section.

EK: what do you mean by non-information?

AC: Coming from semantic web community. Anything that is not sent on the wire. The devices, people, abstract concepts, are non-information resources. We will need to check if we can make this terminology more explicit in the report (maybe include it in the terminology section?).

DV: So profiles describe a non-information resource. This is part of the web architecture.

DV: Profile is a term that is overloaded and used in different contexts. Some examples:

[https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-profile/](https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-profile/)

[https://www.w3.org/TR/dx-prof-conneg/](https://www.w3.org/TR/dx-prof-conneg/)

[https://www.w3.org/TR/dx-prof/](https://www.w3.org/TR/dx-prof/)

[https://w3c.github.io/dxwg/profiles/](https://w3c.github.io/dxwg/profiles/)

DV: In WoT there is also a definition of profiles. DV asks for clarification from EK on the interpretation in the WoT. A note might be added to the report to remove ambiguity.

EK: It is denoting a subset of the TD. like bluetooth. a keyboard does not do audio transmission.

DV: OK I will get back to you on this.

DV: Following the structure of Section 4, started looking for recommendations and practices for defining such profiles. Current notes in the report refer to linking, data formats, and versioning.

DV: The content that ... should come from specifications. That way they stay orthogonal and promote interoperability.

DV: These are the general requirements or aspects, we can go into specific examples now.

AC: There is a recommendation about dereferencing URI and you should get a document that describes the non-information resource. Some references that come to mind:

[https://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#pr-describe-resource](https://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#pr-describe-resource) 

[https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html](https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html)

AC: We should have cross references between identification, profiles and verifiable credentials. The combination gives an identity.

DV: I will get into FOAF profiles (linked in the document as an example). They include links across profiles so that one can discover more profiles.

DV: Then there is Webid profile. Compared to foaf, it also talks about abilities and preferences (access controls). 

EK: What defines the scopes of these specs, and what defines the profiles of people? Is there only one vocabularies, or can there be multiple?

DV: FOAF profiles are based on the FOAF vocabulary, but I don't think there are strong limitations on being forced to use only that vocabulary when defining the profile.

EK: So would it be necessary to use an additional vocabulary for preferences?

DV: Solid WebID profiles are also covering requirements specific to the Solid protocol, which brings these additional terms.

EK: I would then not necessarily consider them different types of profiles.

DV: I also do not necessarily see them differently. I am including them side by side because we see a progression of the scope.

DV: Other approaches are coming from the autonomous agents and MAS communities. One such example is the FIPA Agent Identifier Description. Here, the goal is not to share data, but to enable agents to discover one another and interact. It includes an agent identifier, an address for receiving messages, known agent interaction protocols, known ontologies, and other data. We see preferences across protocols, ontologies, and languages.

DV: FIPA protocol is built on the HTTP. 

AO: Do we know if FIPA website will ever be available again? It is down since a couple months.

AC: Yes I will ask the community. I have linked the last version from the webarchive:

[https://web.archive.org/web/20250826233645/http://fipa.org/](https://web.archive.org/web/20250826233645/http://fipa.org/)

DV: I have also some more contemporary ones. First is MCP Client capabilities.

DV: It allows building negotiation between client and server. 

EK: I need to go :)

AC: I was wondering if MCP Client Capabilities would fit within scope. The danger is in mixing different levels of abstraction.

DV: Highlights the elicitation feature to be discussed: [https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/learn/client-concepts#core-client-features](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/learn/client-concepts#core-client-features)

PDM: Some of the concepts from MCP could provide a starting point. The model system cards are also interesting:
