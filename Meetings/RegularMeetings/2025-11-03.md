## Meeting Notes

AC: Suggests that we discuss the upcoming TPAC next week.

TPAC meeting will be 7:30 am CET ([https://zonestamp.toolforge.org/1762756200)](https://zonestamp.toolforge.org/1762756200)) on Monday 10 Nov. 2025

TPAC meeting is in Japan or online

Registration is needed (deadline past)

There will be a short presentation of the group highlighting how we could liaise with other groups

#### Proposed agenda:

   * Ege will cover history of the community group and how ideas evolved
   * Andrei will talk about the grounding on Web arch and context
   * Finally, interop report:
       * Contextualization to issue #507: [https://github.com/w3c/strategy/issues/507](https://github.com/w3c/strategy/issues/507)
       * Goal
       * Current state
       * Short term plan
VS: it's important for people to know what are the products of the CG

AC: main output should be the interop report

VS: output ok but it's a question of how much time we spend on presentation of the different points

AC: we can have a demo

TRP: the demo to be presented at TPAC (that was also presented at the Hyperagents workshop hybrid meeting)  was good, but one thing that was not so clear to me (initially) was how the agents became discoverable.  It could have been me missing something, but ensure that the way in which agents (and environments?) are discovered should be clarified 

AC: we want to show bridges to existing technologies (MCP, etc.)

#### Architectural considerations (follow-up on hybrid meeting)

Discuss architectural patterns

When we talk about arch. patterns, we talk about network based arch. where the Web comes into play

AC: We would like to raise awareness about what we are doing

RC: we should share the definitions on the list, ask people to react and try reach consensus

AC: this will be WIP at the time of the TPAC, so consensus may not be reached (yet)

AC shows overview of the pattern with a figure from Denny Weyns

AC: if we think of MCP, it was meant to be an adaptation layer to different services with a natural language interface; we could have a layer with TDs that describe the services etc

AC: we want to know where MCP, A2A and others fit in the picture

AO: Maybe we could use this meeting to issue a call for examples of implementations using web agents, with the goal of verifying if indeed the patterns are valid, and to see if other invariants across implementations can be identified.

AC: it is certainly on the roadmap to have a round of validation once the patterns are finalized. Validation could be looking at how various existing AI agents stuff fits

#### Design-goals/non-functional properties

At the hybrid meeting we listed NFPs we would like to have (see notes from meeting 25 Oct. 2025):

situatedness

embodiment

scalability

evolvability

extensibility

heterogeneity

transparency

security

robustness

openness/discoverability

RC: we could merge situatedness and embodiment

AO: maybe could be good to have ... also maybe observability could be a desired property

AC: could this be transparency?

AO: maybe but transparency is a much broader term

AO: some properties are of the agents, others are of the system  

 ... situatedness is more of the agents

 ... scalability is more of the system

RC: observability could be of the environment or the agents

AO: we may want to know certain properties of agents

RC: this would be embodiment

HKG: this also connects to discoverability

AC: openness may be too broad

AO: but openness is distinct, we should keep it
