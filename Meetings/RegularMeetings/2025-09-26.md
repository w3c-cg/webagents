## Meeting Notes

### Hybrid CG meeting @ ECAI 2025

ECAI 2025: [https://ecai2025.org/](https://ecai2025.org/)

Coordinates:

   * the venue is The Engineering School, University of Bologna: [https://ecai2025.org/venues/](https://ecai2025.org/venues/)
   * we can rent a room with 25 seats for the afternoon of Oct. 25
       * see also the ECAI 2025 schedule at a glance: [https://ecai2025.org/schedule-at-a-glance/](https://ecai2025.org/schedule-at-a-glance/)
   * the CG meeting is co-located with the HyperAgents 2025 workshop on Oct. 26: [https://ecai2025.hyperagents.org/](https://ecai2025.hyperagents.org/)
   * for anyone joining only the CG meeting in person, there will be a reduced ECAI-2025 registration fee of 60 EUR + VAT; this covers the coffee breaks and access to the facilities (not the rent for the room itself)

Current agenda proposal (afternoon of Oct. 25):

   * **14:00-14:15** Welcome and agenda setting
   * **14:15-15:30** Focused discussion
       * main topic: architectural considerations for Web-based agents and multi-agent systems
   * **15:30-16:00** Coffee Break
   * **16:00-17:00** Demo / Hands-on session for validating the architectural patterns
   * **17:00-17:30** Wrap up and next steps

Potential issue with Internet connection. We may have to rely on 5G. The room must be rented for 130 EUR + VAT. Univ. St-Gallen can cover this.  

A good outcome would be to end up with a good diagram of the architecture.  Also, gather inputs for the W3C and its AI activity.

Possibly have breakout groups to work on different topics.        

JL: How will architectural patterns help?

OG: Plan to come up with an architecture diagram - are there facilities for discussion (Whiteboard, etc.).

AC: We have a screen or projector, SM to provide a 360 microphone. - will ask about whiteboards

AC: Repeated JL question

JL: Confirmed point about the importance of architectural patterns in the document

AC: Sees them as a blueprint for the document

AC: Reviewing report - has concern that the Agentic approaches are reducing the environment to interactions support (HTTP as transport)

AC: Re-emphasizing the value of the web as a distributed hypermedia environment - there are demos of the approach

AC: Referencing design goals / architectural patterns as per DID spec ([https://www.w3.org/TR/did-1.0/#design-goals)](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-1.0/#design-goals))

AC: presenting DW situated agent design pattern

AC: Moving on to the discussion of the virtual environment pattern

AC: MCP Server is just an instantiation of this pattern

JL: Asks about other sections and whether we need patterns for each one.

AC:  We should emphasize that we are interested in Open Environments rather than Closed Environments

AC: Mentioned IEFT CORE working group - 

RC: Mentioned inviting DW to participate in the Hybrid Meeting \& Possibly HyperAgents

AC: Wrapping up...

OG: @AC: Please can you clarify daily rates
