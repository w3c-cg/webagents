## Meeting Notes

Andrei: Progress on the section on identification (Section 4 here: [https://deploy-preview-107--w3cwebagentscg.netlify.app/#identification)](https://deploy-preview-107--w3cwebagentscg.netlify.app/#identification))

Quick review of the previous meeting notes. The plan of sections 4 to 11 was discussed. These sections should review what currently exists.

A pull request has been made for section 4: [https://github.com/w3c-cg/webagents/pull/107](https://github.com/w3c-cg/webagents/pull/107)

A core principle for identification is Principle 1 (uniform resource space), defined in the architectural constraints section.

The section on identification (and the following sections) should present a top-down view of what exists. 

Top down requirements for identification should be derived from and aligned with design principles from the Web architecture: [https://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#identification](https://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#identification)

The principles may or may not be followed by the different approaches that are reviewed in the state of the art.

The main constraints and recommended practices from the WebArch specs are reviewed. IRIs are used for identification. DID is a subclass of IRI that is used by some approaches, but using DIDs is not required to be aligned with the Web architecture.

Antoine: Controlled Identifiers ([https://www.w3.org/TR/cid-1.0/)](https://www.w3.org/TR/cid-1.0/)) are not mentioned. The specification defines a document for controlled identifiers to perform cryptographic verification, but not the identifiers themselves. This has been mentioned in the Linked Web Storage WG. 

Andrei: This is a document that provides more information about an identifier, that is used to provide verification.  Another relevant category is capability URLs: URLs that are very hard to guess. This is either relevant to the identification section or the security section.

Dereferencing an IRI should return a representation of the identified resource. Linked Data principles could be applied. In particular, if the identified resource is a non-information resource, it should return an information resource that describes the targeted resource. 

Explanation and potential relevance of the different principles from [https://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#identification](https://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#identification)

Andrei Olaru: question about whether the use of hierarchy in URI contradicts the URI opacity principle.

Andrei: There are good practices to follow when designing URIs. However, users of URIs should assume opacity. Otherwise, we rely on information that needs to be hard-coded in clients.

Section 4 should discuss the application of the general principles to the different protocols/MAS identified in the state of the art, but it should not be normative. 

Ege: URIs are very general and are not necessarily dereferenceable.

Andrei: An example would be a URN. A drawback of using URN is that you also need a discovery mechanism. 

Rem: issue with MCP is that with many MCP services, there is not a direct way to identify a tool. For example, two different tools on two different MCP servers may have the same name. Therefore, the name of a tool is not enough to identify it.

Jeremy: question about agents can prove an identifier belongs to them. Mentions the controlled identifiers discussed before.

Andrei: This is related to identities rather than identifiers. Both are related: identities are built on top of identifiers, profiles, and verifiable credentials, which are covered in different sections. WebID as an example. Possibility to create a section on identities.

The structure of the identification section includes agent identification and tool identification, but the distinction may not always be clear-cut.

Danai: similar issues on the profile section (Section 5). Not much progress on Section 5, yet. 

Rem: Other sections remain open to potential writers. Issues have been identified with MCP, for example with respect to the number of tools. 

Andrei: The discussion of Section 4 can include why dereferenceable URIs are good for discovery, and why additional discovery mechanisms are necessary for non-dereferenceable URIs. This discussion would be continued with the section on discoverability. 

Jeremy: question on the lack of normativity in the report: does it mean the report will make no recommendation (e.g., whether IRIs or strings should be used to identify tools)? 

Andrei: The report is not normative in the sense that it does not propose a standard. However, it proposes a critical look at what exists. For example, it can indicate what is lost if IRIs are not used as identifiers.
