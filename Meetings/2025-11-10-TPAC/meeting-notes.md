AC: Overview of TF Report document structure



AC: Moving on to discuss the topic of Agents on the Web



AC: Presenting various historical perspectives on Agents (FIPA/Agent Cities; DARPA CoABS \& DAML)



AC: Now presenting Agents and Web Services \& unpacking a richer model of MAS: environments, agents and organisations.



AC: Moving on to discuss the role of the Web in this extended model.  This includes an explanation of affordances and how they are realised on the Web.



AC: Now discussing Architectural Design of hMAS



AC: Presented Design Goals



AC: Now presenting Architectural Patterns



AC: Moving on to Architectural Constraints



AC: Will skip the demonstrator



EK: Makes call for comments



Sarven: Can these agents misbehave / can the web be misused / what about accountability?



AC: Pointed out the relevent sections of the report \& that there are members of the CG who are active researchers in these topics.



Sarven: This is a good start



AC: 



Lionel: Web Accessibility TF - method for making Web destinations clearer. There will be a presentation in 1hr that will discuss this topic and its relevence to Agentic.



AC: This is something we call "Exploration Guidance"



Lionel: Will bring the terminology



Vasily: From Block. We have lots of information on how to use tools and representation formats. What are the limitations/hurdles on what tools are available now



AC: Repeats: What are the biggest hurdles to using the web as it is now?



Vasily: Confirms this is the question



AC: It is tricky to deliver this without a shift - has parallels with Context Engineering;



AC: Levels of support - reflective level of support - choosing what to sense and when



AC: Perception is always the bottleneck



AC: Is there something missing from what we have covered so far?



Serven: Lot of talk about engineering? not enough about the impact on the web and on society



AC: Thanks - a great point. We could add a section on Ethical Considerations



RC: Definitely makes sense - we should consider it



AC: Perhaps we can have a CG session on this in the near future



Lionel: What other organisations are working in a similar domain?



AC: Great question - maybe there are other people that are better placed to answer this.



AC: We live in the age of open standards - there are many initiatives MCP, A2A, UTCP, that are industry-led and without being part of a standardization body.



AC: The main standardisation bodies: IETF, IEEE, ...
