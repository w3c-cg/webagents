# Want to Contribute?

Great! You can contribute to reports created by the Interoperability Task Force in one of two ways:

1. Indirectly via issues: Pick a relevant issue (if any) â€” or create a new one that describes your contribution.

2. Directly via pull requests: Fork this repository, edit the report to add your contribution, and open a pull request when ready.

If you wish to contribute directly via a pull request, you should:
- join the [WebAgents Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/webagents/)
- connect your GitHub account to your W3C account; this option is available on your account page on the W3C website under "Connected Accounts"

If you wish to contribute, but are unsure where and how to do so, we invite you to join our regular meetings (see [calendar](https://www.w3.org/groups/cg/webagents/calendar/)). Alternatively, you can also reach out to Andrei Ciortea and Rem Collier via email.
