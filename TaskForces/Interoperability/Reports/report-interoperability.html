      <p>Advances in language agents that can follow instructions and use tools have renewed interest in autonomous agents and multi-agent systems. Like previous generations of agents, language agents are designed for specific tasks, highlighting the need for open networks of agents that complement each other's abilities to tackle more complex problems. New protocols are rapidly emerging to allow agents to discover and use tools, or to discover and interact with other agents. Some of these protocols build on Web standards to promote interoperability, but their alignments, misalignments, and overlaps are unclear. This report synthesizes the large body of research on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems (MAS) to define a conceptual model for understanding Web-based MAS. We use this conceptual model to classify existing technologies and frameworks, to identify relevant standards within the W3C, and to discover standardization gaps (if any).</p>

        <h3>Visions of Agents on the Web</h3>

        <!-- <aside class="issue">
          <p>The vision of agents on the Web is almost as old as the Web itself. This section is to give a concise overview for contextualization. Relevant: WWW94 keynote, DARPA research programs (CoABS and DAML) and the Semantic Web, AgentCities and FIPA, and the recent Dagstuhl seminars.</p>
        </aside> -->

        <p>The vision of intelligent agents on the Web is almost as old as the Web itself: in a <a href="https://videos.cern.ch/record/2671957">keynote at WWW'94</a>, Sir Tim Berners-Lee was noting that documents on the Web describe real objects and relationships among them, and if the semantics of these objects are represented explicitly then machines can browse through and manipulate reality. This vision was published in 2001 as the Semantic Web [Berners-Lee et al., 2001] — and is now closer to its realization through the standardization of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WoT/">Web of Things (WoT)</a> at the W3C and the IETF.</p>

        <p>In the AI community, the vision of a world-wide open network of intelligent agents can be traced back to the late '90s. In 2002, the <a href="https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/IST-2000-28385/">AgentCities</a> initiative was reporting a network of 41 agent platforms deployed in 21 countries [Willmott et al., 2002] — with up to 60 registered platforms reported in 2003 [Dale et al., 2003] and 160 platforms in 2005 [Bellifemine et al., 2005]. The network was based on the <a href="http://www.fipa.org/repository/standardspecs.html">standards produced by the Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents (FIPA)</a>, but quickly faded after the mid-2000s as industry attention shifted to Web services. Another prominent initative was the DARPA Control of Agent-Based Systems (CoABS) research program [TODO], which investigated the control, coordination, and management of large systems of autonomous software agents in military applications. Central to this program, CoABS Grid was the middleware integrating heterogeneous agent-based systems, object-based applications, and legacy systems using remote method invocation as a client-server style for network-based interaction.</p>

        <p>The DARPA CoABS program demonstrated the use of agent technology in large-scale practical applications, but also raised a number of challenges, such as enabling software agents to dynamically identify and understand information sources [TODO]. To address these, DARPA launched the Agent Markup Language (DAML) research program, which built on top of existing Web standards and paved the way for the Web Ontology Language (OWL), Semantic Markup for Web Services (OWL-S), and other cornerstones of the Semantic Web. The DAML program thus advanced the original vision of the Web as an information space not only for people but also for intelligent agents, and promoted a shift from custom-built middleware for MAS — such as CoABS Grid or FIPA implementations — to offloading many of those responsibilities to the existing Web infrastructure. Web-based MAS received significant attention over the years, especially with the advent of service-oriented computing in the early 2000s [Singh and Huhns, 2006].</p>

        <p>Recent years have brought renewed interest in Web-based MAS, as evidenced by the <a href="https://www.dagstuhl.de/21072">Dagstuhl Seminar 21072</a> (Feb. 2021) and <a href="https://dagstuhl.de/23081">Dagstuhl Seminar 23081</a> (Feb. 2023) on "Agents on the Web" that led to the creation of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/webagents/">W3C Autonomous Agents on the Web (WebAgents) Community Group</a>. One key development is the Web of Things (WoT) [TODO], which unlocks new practical use cases for agents on the Web — and implements several visionary ideas expressed in the motivating scenarios from the original Semantic Web paper [Berners-Lee et al., 2001]. Another key development is the recent progreess in language agents that can follow instructions and use tools: just like previous generations of agents, language agents are designed for specific tasks, highlighting the need for open networks of agents that complement each other's abilities to tackle more complex problems. New protocols and frameworks are rapidly emerging to allow agents to discover and use tools, or to discover and interact with other agents — and many of these initiatives build on Web standards tos promote interoperability (e.g., see the <a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/">Model Context Protocol</a>, <a href="https://google-a2a.github.io/A2A/">Agent2Agent Protocol</a>, <a href="https://agent-network-protocol.com/">Agent Network Protocol</a>, <a href="https://eclipse.dev/lmos/">Eclipse LMOS</a>).</p>

          <h3>Agents and Web Services</h3>
          
          <aside class="issue">
            <p>This section is to summarize the research on Web-based MAS, from service-oriented computing in the early 2000s to current work on Hypermedia MAS.</p>
          </aside>
          <p>The integration of agents with Web services is about as old as the history of Web services themselves. In 1996, the <a href="http://fipa.org/">Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents (FIPA)</a> was created to develop standards for MAS. These standards include FIPA-ACL, an agent communication language, but also a standardization on the <a href="http://fipa.org/specs/fipa00001/SC00001L.pdf">abstract architecture</a> of a MAS and its components, such as directory facilitators to discover services. While these standards were not all specific to Web-based MAS and could be used to develop local MAS applications, for example using <a href="https://jade.tilab.com/">JADE (Java Agent DEvelopment Framework)</a>, many were applied to the development of Web-based MAS. In particular, the AgentCities project relied on FIPA standards to develop an international Web-based MAS [[AGENTCITIES]]. A related development was the development of the Semantic Web to provide machine-readable information describing Web resources for Web-based agents [[SEMWEB]]. The Semantic Web led to the creation of ontologies to describe Web services so that they can be used by machines. While other standards have been developed to describe Web services, such as the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl/">Web Services Description Language (WSDL)</a>, Semantic Web representations can be used to provide richer semantics to enable the use of these services by software agents through the use of specific ontologies. The OWL-S ontology is one of the ontologies that has been developed for that purpose [[OWLS]]. OWL-S can be used to describe what a service does, the processes associated with the service and how to use the service. </p>
          <p> The early approaches on Web-based MAS were considering the Web mostly  as a transport layer for messages among agents rather than an application architecture for a MAS across its different dimensions, including the environment dimension [[DECADE]]. New approaches to develop Web-based MAS relying on the REST architectural style were created. One of them is Multi-Agent Microservices (MAMS), an approach that relies on the REST and microservice architectural styles to design Web-based Multi-Agent Systems [[MAMS]]. In a MAMS system, agents and other entities present in a MAS, such as artifacts, are exposed as microservices on the Web and can therefore be interacted with as such. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-architecture/">Web of Things (WoT)</a> provides a way to integrate Internet of Things (IoT) devices as part of the Web. A core standard of the WoT is the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-thing-description/"> Thing Description (TD)</a>, which provides a hypermedia semantic description of a Thing using JSON-LD. Given similarities between the TD model and the concept of artifacts, used to represent environmental entities in the Agents & Artifacts (A&A) meta-model, TDs can be used to integrate MAS environments, developed using the A&A model, as part of the Web of Things [[YGGDRASIL2018]]. This insight leads to the practical instantiation of hypermedia MAS, which are MAS that are integrated within the Web architecture and hypermedia principles [[DECADE]], are used to enable the discovery of entities in the MAS and how to interact with them. Yggdrasil is a platform that enables the creation of hypermedia MAS by exposing artifacts as Thing Descriptions [[YGGDRASIL2018]]. More recently, the <a href="https://purl.org/hmas">HMAS Ontology</a> can be used instead of the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wot-thing-description/ontology/td.html">Thing Description Ontology</a> to describe the components of an hypermedia MAS. </p>

        <aside class="issue">
          <p>Different approaches choose different distribution styles, e.g. MCP uses an RPC-style of distribution. This section discusses these different styles with reference to the Web architecture. The discussion could go into many directions, what emerged in our meetings is a need to look deeper than the agent level of abstraction. What seems important is to identify alignments and misalignments with the Web architecture.</p>
