      <p>Advances in language agents that can follow instructions and use tools have renewed interest in autonomous agents and multi-agent systems. Like previous generations of agents, language agents are designed for specific tasks, highlighting the need for open networks of agents that complement each other's abilities to tackle more complex problems. New protocols are rapidly emerging to allow agents to discover and use tools, or to discover and interact with other agents. Some of these protocols build on Web standards to promote interoperability, but their alignments, misalignments, and overlaps are unclear. This report synthesizes the large body of research on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems (MAS) to define a conceptual model for understanding Web-based MAS. We use this conceptual model to classify existing technologies and frameworks, to identify relevant standards within the W3C, and to discover standardization gaps (if any).</p>

        <h3>Visions of Agents on the Web</h3>

        <!-- <aside class="issue">
          <p>The vision of agents on the Web is almost as old as the Web itself. This section is to give a concise overview for contextualization. Relevant: WWW94 keynote, DARPA research programs (CoABS and DAML) and the Semantic Web, AgentCities and FIPA, and the recent Dagstuhl seminars.</p>
        </aside> -->

        <p>The vision of intelligent agents on the Web is almost as old as the Web itself: in a <a href="https://videos.cern.ch/record/2671957">keynote at WWW'94</a>, Sir Tim Berners-Lee was noting that documents on the Web describe real objects and relationships among them, and if the semantics of these objects are represented explicitly then machines can browse through and manipulate reality. This vision was published in 2001 as the Semantic Web [Berners-Lee et al., 2001] — and is now closer to its realization through the standardization of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WoT/">Web of Things (WoT)</a> at the W3C and the IETF.</p>

        <p>In the AI community, the vision of a world-wide open network of intelligent agents can be traced back to the late '90s. In 2002, the <a href="https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/IST-2000-28385/">AgentCities</a> initiative was reporting a network of 41 agent platforms deployed in 21 countries [Willmott et al., 2002] — with up to 60 registered platforms reported in 2003 [Dale et al., 2003] and 160 platforms in 2005 [Bellifemine et al., 2005]. The network was based on the <a href="http://www.fipa.org/repository/standardspecs.html">standards produced by the Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents (FIPA)</a>, but quickly faded after the mid-2000s as industry attention shifted to Web services. Another prominent initative was the DARPA Control of Agent-Based Systems (CoABS) research program [TODO], which investigated the control, coordination, and management of large systems of autonomous software agents in military applications. Central to this program, CoABS Grid was the middleware integrating heterogeneous agent-based systems, object-based applications, and legacy systems using remote method invocation as a client-server style for network-based interaction.</p>

        <p>The DARPA CoABS program demonstrated the use of agent technology in large-scale practical applications, but also raised a number of challenges, such as enabling software agents to dynamically identify and understand information sources [TODO]. To address these, DARPA launched the Agent Markup Language (DAML) research program, which built on top of existing Web standards and paved the way for the Web Ontology Language (OWL), Semantic Markup for Web Services (OWL-S), and other cornerstones of the Semantic Web. The DAML program thus advanced the original vision of the Web as an information space not only for people but also for intelligent agents, and promoted a shift from custom-built middleware for MAS — such as CoABS Grid or FIPA implementations — to offloading many of those responsibilities to the existing Web infrastructure. Web-based MAS received significant attention over the years, especially with the advent of service-oriented computing in the early 2000s [Singh and Huhns, 2006].</p>

        <p>Recent years have brought renewed interest in Web-based MAS, as evidenced by the <a href="https://www.dagstuhl.de/21072">Dagstuhl Seminar 21072</a> (Feb. 2021) and <a href="https://dagstuhl.de/23081">Dagstuhl Seminar 23081</a> (Feb. 2023) on "Agents on the Web" that led to the creation of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/webagents/">W3C Autonomous Agents on the Web (WebAgents) Community Group</a>. One key development is the Web of Things (WoT) [TODO], which unlocks new practical use cases for agents on the Web — and implements several visionary ideas expressed in the motivating scenarios from the original Semantic Web paper [Berners-Lee et al., 2001]. Another key development is the recent progreess in language agents that can follow instructions and use tools: just like previous generations of agents, language agents are designed for specific tasks, highlighting the need for open networks of agents that complement each other's abilities to tackle more complex problems. New protocols and frameworks are rapidly emerging to allow agents to discover and use tools, or to discover and interact with other agents — and many of these initiatives build on Web standards tos promote interoperability (e.g., see the <a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/">Model Context Protocol</a>, <a href="https://google-a2a.github.io/A2A/">Agent2Agent Protocol</a>, <a href="https://agent-network-protocol.com/">Agent Network Protocol</a>, <a href="https://eclipse.dev/lmos/">Eclipse LMOS</a>).</p>

          <h3>Agentic AI</h3>
          
          <aside class="issue">
            <p>This section is to summarize relevant developments around AI agents and agentic AI (e.g., MCP, A2A, ANP, LMOS, etc.).</p>
          </aside>
	  <p>The concept of Agentic AI refers to AI systems that are able to take autonomous decisions in order to achieve goals. The term is commonly used to refer more specifically to autonomous generative AI systems. </p>
	  <p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are a core technology to create agentic AI systems. More precisely, a core component to create <a href="#dfn-language-agent">language agents</a>, is an <a href="#dfn-augmented-llm">Augmented Language Model</a> (ALM), which is an LLM extended with the ability to reason and the ability to use <a>tools</a> [[TMLR23]]. These ALMs are building blocks to create agents [[ANTHROPIC24]]. The <a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/">Model Context Protocol (MCP)</a> is a protocol to enable ALMs and language agents to connect with external tools and data sources. The protocol thus enables a separation of concerns between agents and tools/data sources. In practice, MCP servers can be run on the same machine or can be accessed through the Internet (e.g., via server sent events or streamable HTTP). <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/source/features/company-news/introducing-nlweb-bringing-conversational-interfaces-directly-to-the-web/">NLWeb</a> relies on MCP to integrate conversational interfaces within websites, thus aiming to become the HTML of the Agentic Web. Another extension is the <a href="https://www.utcp.io/">Universal Tool Calling Protocol (UTCP)</a>, which aims to provide a universal interface for different tools, including MCP tools, and tools directly usable with the HTTP protocol and providing an OpenAPI description. UTCP relies on manuals that indicate how to interact with a set of tools. The protocol relies on this manual to interact with tools and provide information to LLM agents on the nature of the tools. </p>

	  <p> Agentic AI is also considering communication among language agents. Different protocols are being developed to enable communication of language agents on the Web. The <a href="https://www.a2aprotocol.net/docs/introduction">Agent2Agent (A2A)</a> protocol is a protocol that is meant as a complement to MCP for agent communication. Agents using this protocol describe themselves and their capabilities in an Agent Card that is available on the Web for other agents to read and use. The protocol defines tasks that an agent can achieve on behalf of another and messages to support communication among agents. The protocol relies on <a href="https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification">JSON-RPC</a> for communication. The Agent Communication Protocol (ACP) was another protocol intended to enable communication between LLM agents, which directly used HTTP APIs for agent interactions [[ACP]]. However, the project has been integrated within the A2A project under control by the Linux Foundation [[ACP]]. The <a href="https://agoraprotocol.org/docs/getting-started">Agora protocol</a> is protocol for communication among language agents meant to be as versatile, efficient, and portable as possible, within the limit of the Agent Communication Trilemma between these three properties [[AGORA]]. The Agora protocol enables agents to choose at run time which specific protocol to use for interaction [[AGORA]].  The <a href="https://agent-network-protocol.com/specs/white-paper.html"> Agent Network Protocol (ANP)</a> is another protocol for agents on the Web. ANP defines three layers: the Identity layer, the Meta-Protocol layer, and the Application layer. The Identity layer relies on <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-1.0/">Decentralized Identifiers (DID)</a> to identify the agents. ANP defines a custom DID method <code>did:wba</code>, for Web-based Agents, to enable agents to prove their identities without relying on a central authority. The Meta-Protocol layer enables agents to select which protocol to use for communication. Once a protocol has been selected, the agents communicate using that protocol. Finally, the Application layer defines a JSON-LD Agent Description (AD) to enable agents to provide information about themselves to other agents and an Agent Discovery Protocol to enable agents to discover the ADs of other agents. <a href="https://eclipse.dev/lmos/">Eclipse LMOS (Language Model Operating System)</a> is another project to build an Internet of Agents. Eclipse LMOS relies on DIDs to identify software agents. It also defines an Agent Description Format to describe agents and a Tool Description Format to describe tools. Both description formats are defined as built on top of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-thing-description/"> Thing Description (TD) Format</a>. Eclipse LMOS also defines mecanisms for discovery, and a it can rely on WebSocket as a communication protocol. </p>

        <h3>Architectural Considerations</h3>
      
        <aside class="issue">
          <p>Different approaches choose different distribution styles, e.g. MCP uses an RPC-style of distribution. This section discusses these different styles with reference to the Web architecture. The discussion could go into many directions, what emerged in our meetings is a need to look deeper than the agent level of abstraction. What seems important is to identify alignments and misalignments with the Web architecture.</p>
