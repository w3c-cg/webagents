      <p>Advances in large language models (LLMs) that can follow instructions and use tools have renewed interest in autonomous agents and multi-agent systems. Like previous generations of agents, LLM-based agents are designed for specific tasks, highlighting the need for open networks of agents that complement each other's abilities to tackle more complex problems. New protocols are rapidly emerging to allow agents to discover and use tools, or to discover and interact with other agents. Some of these protocols build on Web standards to promote interoperability, but their alignments, misalignments, and overlaps are unclear. This report synthesizes the large body of research on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems (MAS) to define a conceptual model for understanding Web-based MAS. We use this conceptual model to classify existing technologies and frameworks, to identify relevant standards within the W3C, and to discover standardization gaps (if any).</p>

        <h3>Visions of Agents on the Web</h3>

        <!-- <aside class="issue">
          <p>The vision of agents on the Web is almost as old as the Web itself. This section is to give a concise overview for contextualization. Relevant: WWW94 keynote, DARPA research programs (CoABS and DAML) and the Semantic Web, AgentCities and FIPA, and the recent Dagstuhl seminars.</p>
        </aside> -->

        <p>The vision of intelligent agents on the Web is almost as old as the Web itself: in a <a href="https://videos.cern.ch/record/2671957">keynote at WWW'94</a>, Sir Tim Berners-Lee was noting that documents on the Web describe real objects and relationships among them, and if the semantics of these objects are represented explicitly then machines can browse through and manipulate reality. This vision was articulated more fully in the 2001 Semantic Web paper [[SEMWEB01]] and is now closer to realization through the standardization of the Web of Things at <a href="https://www.w3.org/WoT/">the W3C</a> and <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/core/">the IETF</a>.</p>

        <p>In the AI community, the vision of a world-wide open network of intelligent agents also emerged in the '90s. In 2002, the <a href="https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/IST-2000-28385/">AgentCities</a> initiative was reporting a network of 41 agent platforms deployed in 21 countries [[WILLMOTT02]], which grew to 60 registered platforms in 2003 [[DALE03]] and 160 by 2005 [[JADE]]. This network was based on <a href="http://www.fipa.org/repository/standardspecs.html">standards developed by the Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents (FIPA)</a> but declined after the mid-2000s as industry attention shifted toward Web services. In parallel with AgentCities, the DARPA Control of Agent-Based Systems (CoABS) research program investigated the control, coordination, and management of large systems of autonomous software agents in military applications. Its central middleware, the CoABS Grid [[COABS1]], integrated heterogeneous agent-based systems, object-based applications, and legacy systems.</p>

        <p>The DARPA CoABS program demonstrated the practical utility of agent technologies in large-scale deployments, while also highlighting significant challenges — for example, enabling agents to dynamically identify and interpret information sources [[COABS2]]. To address such issues, DARPA launched the Agent Markup Language (DAML) research program, which extended existing Web standards and laid the groundwork for the Web Ontology Language (OWL), Semantic Markup for Web Services (OWL-S), and other cornerstones of the Semantic Web. The DAML program advanced the original vision of the Web as an information space for both people and intelligent agents, and encouraged a shift from custom-built MAS middleware (e.g., CoABS Grid or FIPA platforms) to leveraging the Web's existing infrastructure. Such Web-based MAS received significant attention over the years, especially in the early 2000s with the advent of service-oriented computing [[SINGH06]].</p>

        <p>Recent years have brought renewed interest in Web-based MAS — as evidenced by the <a href="https://www.dagstuhl.de/21072">Dagstuhl Seminar 21072</a> (Feb. 2021) and <a href="https://dagstuhl.de/23081">Dagstuhl Seminar 23081</a> (Feb. 2023) on "Agents on the Web", which led to the creation of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/webagents/">W3C Autonomous Agents on the Web (WebAgents) Community Group</a>. A key enabler for this renewed interest is the Web of Things, which provides new practical use cases for Web agents and realizes several visionary ideas anticipated in the original Semantic Web paper [[SEMWEB01]]. Another key enabler is the recent progress in LLM-based agents that can follow instructions and use tools: just like previous generations of agents, LLM-based agents are designed for specific tasks, underscoring the need for open networks in which agents complement one another's abilities to solve more complex problems. New protocols and frameworks are emerging to support LLM-based agents to discover and use tools, or to discover and interact with other agents — many of them explicitly building on Web standards to foster interoperability (e.g., see the <a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/">Model Context Protocol</a>, <a href="https://google-a2a.github.io/A2A/">Agent2Agent Protocol</a>, <a href="https://agent-network-protocol.com/">Agent Network Protocol</a>, <a href="https://eclipse.dev/lmos/">Eclipse LMOS</a>).</p>

        <h3>Conceptual Dimensions</h3>

        <p>A <a href="#dfn-mas">multi-agent system</a> (<abbr title="multi-agent system">MAS</abbr>) has several distinguishing features. One key feature is decentralized control, where each <a href="#dfn-agent">agent</a> makes its own decisions and controls its own behavior — yet the MAS as a whole exhibits coordinated behavior to achieve system-level design objectives. Another key feature is that capabilities, knowledge, and resources are distributed among agents, which creates inter-dependencies: agents participate in a MAS because they need to interact with one another to solve problems that would otherwise exceed their individual capacities. Without such inter-dependencies, the MAS would be a collection of isolated agents — and would not constitute a system at all.</p>

        <p>A non-trivial MAS therefore consists of more than just agents: for example, it may also include the <a href="#dfn-tool">tools</a> that agents use to achieve their goals, the <a href="#dfn-aip">protocols</a> through which they interact, and the <a href="#dfn-policy">policies</a> or <a href="#dfn-norm">norms</a> that govern their behavior. In research on <a href="https://emas.in.tu-clausthal.de/">Engineering MAS</a>, these concerns have been organized along four conceptual dimensions [[DEMAZEAU95]]:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Agent dimension</strong>: abstractions for designing and programming agents;</li>
            <li><strong>Environment dimension</strong>: abstractions for designing and programming the shared environment;</li>
            <li><strong>Interaction dimension</strong>: abstractions for specifying interactions among agents and potentially other entities;</li>
            <li><strong>Organization dimension</strong>: abstractions for structuring and governing agent behavior.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>These conceptual dimensions help organize the complexity of non-trivial MAS — and are particularly relevant when designing Web-based MAS [[HMAS]]: they offer a broader conceptual view of MAS (broader than just agents) while also defining the scope of the design space. For example, [[[#mas-web-transport-layer]]] shows a MAS modeled as agents that exchange messages. In this view, the Web is reduced to a message transport layer, an early perspective in research on Web-based MAS (see Section&nbsp;[[[#agents-web-services]]]). However, the Web was not designed as a transport layer (see Section 6.5.3 in [[FIELDING00]]).</p>

        <figure id="mas-web-transport-layer">
          <img src="images/mas-web-transport-layer.png" alt="The Web as a transport layer for messages exchanged among agents." width="350" />
          <figcaption>The Web as a transport layer for messages exchanged among agents.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>In contrast, a broader conceptual view of MAS enables deeper integration with the Web: instead of limiting the Web to a transport layer for agent messages, it can leverage the Web as an application layer for MAS [[HMAS]]. For example, [[[#mas-web-application-layer]]] shows a MAS that incorporates concepts from all four dimensions mentioned above. In this view, the Web serves as the application layer for the agent environment — for example, providing agents with shared tools, resources, and governance mechanisms. This perspective expands the design space for Web-based MAS and aligns more closely with the Web's original purpose and capabilities.</p>

        <h3>Architectural Considerations</h3>
      
        <aside class="issue">
          <p>Different approaches choose different distribution styles, e.g. MCP uses an RPC-style of distribution. This section discusses these different styles with reference to the Web architecture. The discussion could go into many directions, what emerged in our meetings is a need to look deeper than the agent level of abstraction. What seems important is to identify alignments and misalignments with the Web architecture.</p>

          <h3>Design Goals</h3>

          <aside class="issue">
            <p>MAS are a class of systems known for NFPs such as <strong>flexibility/adaptability</strong>, <strong>openness</strong>, <strong>robustness</strong>, and <strong>scalability</strong> [Weyns, 2010]. The Web is a distributed hypermedia system specifcally designed to meet a well-defined set of NFPs, among which <strong>scalability</strong>, <strong>heterogeneity</strong>, <strong>evolvability</strong>, and <strong>extensibility</strong> [Fielding and Taylor, 2002; Taylor et al, 2010]. Inhereting the properties of the Web in Web-based MAS is desirable, which means we need to design MAS that are aligned with the Web Arch [[HMAS]].</p>
