    <section id="abstract">
      <p>Advances in large language models (LLMs) that can follow instructions and use tools have renewed interest in autonomous agents and multi-agent systems. Like previous generations of agents, LLM-based agents are designed for specific tasks, highlighting the need for open networks of agents that complement each other's abilities to tackle more complex problems. New protocols are rapidly emerging to allow agents to discover and use tools, or to discover and interact with other agents. Some of these protocols build on Web standards to promote interoperability, but their alignments, misalignments, and overlaps are unclear. This report synthesizes the large body of research on autonomous agents and multi-agent systems (MAS) to define a conceptual model for understanding Web-based MAS. We use this conceptual model to classify existing technologies and frameworks, to identify relevant standards within the W3C, and to discover standardization gaps (if any).</p>

        <dd>A language model augmented with abilities such as reasoning, tool use, information retrieval, or storing context across interactions. Unlike an <a href="#dfn-agent">agent</a>, an augmented language model does not actively pursue goals and is not <a href="#dfn-situated">situated</a> in an environment. See also [[TMLR23]] and [[ANTHROPIC24]].</dd>

        <dt><dfn id="dfn-llm-agent">LLM Agent</dfn> or <dfn id="dfn-language-agent">Language Agent</dfn></dt>
        <dd>An <a href="#dfn-agent">agent</a> that relies on an LLM to guide their internal processes and interactions with the environment, while maintaining control over how they accomplish tasks [[ANTHROPIC24]][[COALA23]].

        <dd>A system composed of <a href="#dfn-agent">agents</a> that are situated in a shared environment and interact with one another to achieve individual or collective goals.

        <dd>The ability of an <a href="#dfn-agent">agent</a> to interact with its environment directly through perception and action, and to respond in a timely fashion to sensory input.</dd>

        <dt><dfn id="dfn-tool">Tool</dfn> or <dfn id="dfn-artifact">Artifact</dfn></dt>
        <dd>An instrument that can be shared and used by <a href="#dfn-agent">agents</a> to support their activities. In some <a href="#dfn-mas">multi-agent systems</a>, agents construct artifacts to instrument their environments [[JACAMO20]]. In the context of agentic AI, a tool is a functional interface to a program that a language model can invoke. Tools extend the capabilities of LLMs by enabling them to retrieve knowledge not seen during training, perform complex computations, mitigate hallucinations, and perceive or act in an environment [[TOOL]].</dd>

Such tools may expose interfaces over Web or non-Web protocols—for example, a weather service exposing an HTTP API, a lamp exposing a CoAP API, or a telemetry service exposing an MQTT API. Non-Web protocols can be encapsulated behind hypermedia controls published in a description accessible through the Web, such as a W3C Web of Things (WoT) Thing Description [[wot-thing-description11]].</dd>

        <h3>Visions of Agents on the Web</h3>

        <!-- <aside class="issue">
          <p>The vision of agents on the Web is almost as old as the Web itself. This section is to give a concise overview for contextualization. Relevant: WWW94 keynote, DARPA research programs (CoABS and DAML) and the Semantic Web, AgentCities and FIPA, and the recent Dagstuhl seminars.</p>
        </aside> -->

        <p>The vision of intelligent agents on the Web is almost as old as the Web itself: in a <a href="https://videos.cern.ch/record/2671957">keynote at WWW'94</a>, Sir Tim Berners-Lee was noting that documents on the Web describe real objects and relationships among them, and if the semantics of these objects are represented explicitly then machines can browse through and manipulate reality. This vision was articulated more fully in the 2001 Semantic Web paper [[SEMWEB01]] and is now closer to realization through the standardization of the Web of Things at <a href="https://www.w3.org/WoT/">the W3C</a> and <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/core/">the IETF</a>.</p>

        <p>In the AI community, the vision of a world-wide open network of intelligent agents also emerged in the '90s. In 2002, the <a href="https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/IST-2000-28385/">AgentCities</a> initiative was reporting a network of 41 agent platforms deployed in 21 countries [[WILLMOTT02]], which grew to 60 registered platforms in 2003 [[DALE03]] and 160 by 2005 [[JADE05]]. This network was based on <a href="http://www.fipa.org/repository/standardspecs.html">standards developed by the Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents (FIPA)</a> but declined after the mid-2000s as industry attention shifted toward Web services. In parallel with AgentCities, the DARPA Control of Agent-Based Systems (CoABS) research program investigated the control, coordination, and management of large systems of autonomous software agents in military applications. Its central middleware, the CoABS Grid [[COABS1]], integrated heterogeneous agent-based systems, object-based applications, and legacy systems.</p>

        <p>The DARPA CoABS program demonstrated the practical utility of agent technologies in large-scale deployments, while also highlighting significant challenges — for example, enabling agents to dynamically identify and interpret information sources [[COABS2]]. To address such issues, DARPA launched the Agent Markup Language (DAML) research program, which extended existing Web standards and laid the groundwork for the Web Ontology Language (OWL), Semantic Markup for Web Services (OWL-S), and other cornerstones of the Semantic Web. The DAML program advanced the original vision of the Web as an information space for both people and intelligent agents, and encouraged a shift from custom-built MAS middleware (e.g., CoABS Grid or FIPA platforms) to leveraging the Web's existing infrastructure. Such Web-based MAS received significant attention over the years, especially in the early 2000s with the advent of service-oriented computing [[SINGH06]].</p>

        <p>Recent years have brought renewed interest in Web-based MAS — as evidenced by the <a href="https://www.dagstuhl.de/21072">Dagstuhl Seminar 21072</a> (Feb. 2021) and <a href="https://dagstuhl.de/23081">Dagstuhl Seminar 23081</a> (Feb. 2023) on "Agents on the Web", which led to the creation of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/webagents/">W3C Autonomous Agents on the Web (WebAgents) Community Group</a>. A key enabler for this renewed interest is the Web of Things, which provides new practical use cases for Web agents and realizes several visionary ideas anticipated in the original Semantic Web paper [[SEMWEB01]]. Another key enabler is the recent progress in LLM-based agents that can follow instructions and use tools: just like previous generations of agents, LLM-based agents are designed for specific tasks, underscoring the need for open networks in which agents complement one another's abilities to solve more complex problems. New protocols and frameworks are emerging to support LLM-based agents to discover and use tools, or to discover and interact with other agents — many of them explicitly building on Web standards to foster interoperability (e.g., see the <a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/">Model Context Protocol</a>, <a href="https://google-a2a.github.io/A2A/">Agent2Agent Protocol</a>, <a href="https://agent-network-protocol.com/">Agent Network Protocol</a>, <a href="https://eclipse.dev/lmos/">Eclipse LMOS</a>).</p>

        <h3>Conceptual Dimensions</h3>

        <p>A <a href="#dfn-mas">multi-agent system</a> (<abbr title="multi-agent system">MAS</abbr>) has several distinguishing features. One key feature is decentralized control, where each <a href="#dfn-agent">agent</a> makes its own decisions and controls its own behavior — yet the MAS as a whole exhibits coordinated behavior to achieve system-level design objectives. Another key feature is that capabilities, knowledge, and resources are distributed among agents, which creates inter-dependencies: agents participate in a MAS because they need to interact with one another to solve problems that would otherwise exceed their individual capacities. Without such inter-dependencies, the MAS would be a collection of isolated agents — and would not constitute a system at all.</p>

        <p>A non-trivial MAS therefore consists of more than just agents: for example, it may also include the <a href="#dfn-tool">tools</a> that agents use to achieve their goals, the <a href="#dfn-aip">protocols</a> through which they interact, and the <a href="#dfn-policy">policies</a> or <a href="#dfn-norm">norms</a> that govern their behavior. In research on <a href="https://emas.in.tu-clausthal.de/">Engineering MAS</a>, these concerns have been organized along four conceptual dimensions [[DEMAZEAU95]]:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Agent dimension</strong>: abstractions for designing and programming agents;</li>
            <li><strong>Environment dimension</strong>: abstractions for designing and programming the shared environment;</li>
            <li><strong>Interaction dimension</strong>: abstractions for specifying interactions among agents and potentially other entities;</li>
            <li><strong>Organization dimension</strong>: abstractions for structuring and governing agent behavior.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>These conceptual dimensions help organize the complexity of non-trivial MAS — and are particularly relevant when designing Web-based MAS [[HMAS19]]: they offer a broader conceptual view of MAS (broader than just agents) while also defining the scope of the design space. For example, [[[#mas-web-transport-layer]]] shows a MAS modeled as agents that exchange messages. In this view, the Web is reduced to a message transport layer, an early perspective in research on Web-based MAS (see Section&nbsp;[[[#agents-web-services]]]). However, the Web was not designed as a transport layer (see Section 6.5.3 in [[FIELDING00]]).</p>

        <figure id="mas-web-transport-layer">
          <img src="images/mas-web-transport-layer.png" alt="The Web as a transport layer for messages exchanged among agents." width="350" />
          <figcaption>The Web as a transport layer for messages exchanged among agents.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>In contrast, a broader conceptual view of MAS enables deeper integration with the Web: instead of limiting the Web to a transport layer for agent messages, it can leverage the Web as an application layer for MAS [[HMAS19]]. For example, [[[#mas-web-application-layer]]] shows a MAS that incorporates concepts from all four dimensions mentioned above. In this view, the Web serves as the application layer for the agent environment — for example, providing agents with shared tools, resources, and governance mechanisms. This perspective expands the design space for Web-based MAS and aligns more closely with the Web's original purpose and capabilities.</p>

        <figure id="mas-web-application-layer">
          <img src="images/mas-web-rich-application-layer.png" alt="The Web as a rich application layer that can support all sorts of interaction in a MAS." width="600" />
          <figcaption>The Web as an application layer that supports discovery and rich interaction in open MAS.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        Throughout this report, we use these four conceptual dimensions to organize the discussion and emerging technologies.

          <!-- <aside class="issue">
            <p>MAS are a class of systems known for NFPs such as <strong>flexibility/adaptability</strong>, <strong>openness</strong>, <strong>robustness</strong>, and <strong>scalability</strong> [Weyns, 2010]. The Web is a distributed hypermedia system specifcally designed to meet a well-defined set of NFPs, among which <strong>scalability</strong>, <strong>heterogeneity</strong>, <strong>evolvability</strong>, and <strong>extensibility</strong> [Fielding and Taylor, 2002; Taylor et al, 2010]. Inhereting the properties of the Web in Web-based MAS is desirable, which means we need to design MAS that are aligned with the Web Arch [[HMAS19]].</p>

          <p>Scalability, interoperability, extensibility, and evolvability are central goals for designing MAS that can be deployed at scale on the open Web. These goals also motivated many of the key architectural decisions underpinning the Web itself [[TBL89]][[FIELDING00]]. The central hypothesis of this report is that aligning MAS architectures with the Web architecture enables them to inherit these desirable non-functional properties.</p>

          <p>Discoverability is essential for any open system, as demonstrated by the Web itself. Resource monitoring is necessary for agents to perceive the hypermedia environments in which they are situated. Transperency is a prerequisite for accountability, explainability, and trust. Security is a fundamental requirement that is even more critical if agents are to discover and use tools, or to discover and interact with one another on the open Web.</p>

        <section id="architectural-patterns">
          <h3>Architectural Patterns</h3>

        <p>An architectural pattern specifies a general solution to a recurring design problem. [[[#pattern-language]]] shows a set of architectural patterns for situated MAS adapted from [[WEYNS10]]. The patterns are described using components and connectors as the main architectural elements.</p>

        <p>A <i>component</i> is "an abstract unit of software instructions and internal state that provides a transformation of data via its interface" [[FIELDING00]]. A <i>connector</i> is an abstract mechanism that mediates interaction among components [[TAYLOR10]]. We use component-and-connector models because they facilitate alignment with the design of the Web architecture, as captured by the <i>Representational State Transfer (REST)</i> architectural style [[FIELDING00]]: REST defines a set of architectural constraints that apply to the components and connectors of a distributed hypermedia system — and, in addition, treats <i>data elements</i> as first-class architectural elements subject to the same constraints. We return to REST in Section&nbsp;[[[#architectural-constraints]]].</p>

        <p>The original pattern language introduced by Weyns includes five patterns [[WEYNS10]]: <i>situated agent</i>, <i>virtual environment</i>, <i>selective perception</i>, <i>protocol-based communication</i>, and <i>roles &amp; situated commitments</i>. In this report, we focus on the first two — the basic patterns — and leave the others for future work within the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/webagents/">Autonomous Agents on the Web (WebAgents) Community Group</a>. The language may also be extended with new architectural patterns, such as the <i>policies &amp; norms</i> pattern shown in [[[#pattern-language]]].</p>

        <figure id="pattern-language">
          <img src="images/pattern-language.png" alt="A pattern languge for Web-based agents and MAS." width="500" />
          <figcaption>A pattern languge for Web-based agents and MAS.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>In the following, we present the two basic patterns using UML component diagrams. We give concise overviews of the each pattern and illustrate their application in both modern LLM-based MAS and classical MAS (for detailed descriptions, see [[WEYNS10]]). We then discuss network-based connectors, focusing on Web interactions.</p>

        <aside class="note" title="Optional Components and Interfaces">
          <p>The components shown in these architectural patterns are intended as modular building blocks. Depending on the system's requirements, not all components or their interfaces may be needed in a given implementation.</p>
        </aside>

        <figure id="situated-agent">
          <img src="images/situated-agent.png" alt="A pattern for situated agents." width="500" />
          <figcaption>A pattern for situated agents.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>The <i>situated agent</i> pattern shown in [[[#situated-agent]]] includes a single data repository (<i>Memory</i>) and three components: <i>Perception</i>, <i>Decision Making</i>, and <i>Communication</i>. The <i>Memory</i> repository, accessible to all three components, stores both the agent's internal state and state that may be shared with other agents. This state may be static (e.g., a predefined list of contacts) or dynamic (e.g., a perceived change in the environment). <i>Perception</i> is responsible for sensing and interpreting run-time information from the virtual environment — and supports <i>selective perception</i>, enabling the agent to focus on information relevant to its current tasks. <i>Decision Making</i> is responsible for realizing the agent's tasks by invoking actions in the virtual environment. <i>Communication</i> is responsible for handling interactions with other agents.</p>

        <p>One alteration we introduce relative to Weyns' original pattern is an explicit connection between <i>Communication</i> and <i>Decision Making</i>, allowing the latter to trigger communication acts. This configuration is common in more recent agent architectures, such as those employing information protocols [[KIKO23]].</p>

        <p>The <i>situated agent</i> pattern applies naturally to classical agent architectures, such as <i>Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI)</i> agents [[JACAMO20]], which typically make use of all components. In contrast, many current implementations of LLM agents focus primarily on the <i>Decision Making</i> and <i>Memory</i> components: <i>Communication</i> may be implicit to <i>Decision Making</i> and <i>Perception</i>, and in many cases Perception may also be implicit — for example, when the agent perceives its environment only through observations returned by its actions.</p>

        <figure id="virtual-environment">
          <img src="images/virtual-environment.png" alt="A pattern for virtual environments." width="450" />
          <figcaption>A pattern for virtual environments.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        </section>

        <p>The <i>virtual environment</i> pattern shown in [[[#virtual-environment]]] describes an adaptation layer that bridges the agent's level of abstraction with its deployment context. This adaptation layer can be implemented, for example, by a <a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/">Model Context Protocol (MCP)</a> server, a <a href="https://www.utcp.io/">Universal Tool Calling Protocol (UTCP)</a> server, or a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-architecture11/#dfn-wot-thing-description-directory">WoT Thing Description Directory</a>. The <i>virtual environment</i> exposes to agents a set of <i>provided interfaces</i> through which they can sense, act, or exchange messages (top of [[[#virtual-environment]]]), and may also define a set of <i>required interfaces</i> for interacting with the underlying infrastructure (bottom of [[[#virtual-environment]]]). For instance, an MCP server may wrap the HTTP endpoint of an industrial robot (the <i>Operate</i> required interface in [[[#virtual-environment]]]) to expose a set of <a href="#dfn-tool">tools</a> accessible to LLM agents.</p>

        <p>Some virtual environments may include tools that maintain <i>State</i> and implement their own <i>Dynamics</i>, or host <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-architecture11/#dfn-digital-twin">Digital Twins</a> that mirror the state of physical assets through the <i>Synchronization</i> component.</p>

        <p>So far, we have examined components and their interfaces for <i>situated agents</i> and <i>virtual environments</i>. Connectors specify how these components interact. In this report, we are particularly interested in cases where such interactions are realized through the network-based connectors that rely on Web standards and technologies. One of the objectives of this report is to identify existing standards for these connectors and to highlight potential gaps where further standardization may be needed.</p>

          <h3>Architectural Constraints</h3>

          <!-- <aside class="issue">
            <p>This section is currently too condensed. It should also better trace back to Section&nbsp;[[[#design-goals]]].</p>
          </aside> -->

          <p>This section introduces three design principles that constrain the roles and features of components, connectors, and data elements in a Web-based MAS to ensure alignment with the Web architecture. We refer to Web-based MAS that follow these principles as <i>Hypermedia MAS</i>.</p>

          <p>The principles are adapted from — and discussed in detail in — [[CIORTEA19]]. Their theoretical foundation lies in the REST architectural style [[FIELDING00]], but they extend beyond REST to address requirements specific to agents, such as <i>Resource Monitoring</i> (see also [[KHARE04]][[FIELDING17]]).</p>

          <p class="def"><strong>Principle 1 (Uniform resource space)</strong>: All entities in a Hypermedia MAS, and the relations among them, should be represented in a uniform, resource-oriented manner consistent with the Web architecture.</p>

          <p>The core idea behind this first principle is to project the observable state of a Web-based MAS into a uniform, distributed hypermedia environment (cf. [[[#mas-web-application-layer]]]). This promotes <i>Scalability</i> by enabling the seamless distribution across the Web: agents can use hyperlinks to discover and interact with other entities within and across Hypermedia MAS. It also supports <i>Interoperability</i>, <i>Extensibility</i>, and <i>Evolvability</i> through uniform hypermedia views of heterogeneous components.</p>

          <p>The trade-off is decreased efficiency: components must translate between their internal data representations and the uniform representations exposed via their interfaces, which are necessarily less optimized for the specific needs of individual components.</p>

          <aside class="note" title="A Hypermedia-based Design Space">
              <p>The <i>uniform resource space</i> serves as a hypermedia-based design space that can be exploited to provide agents with various levels of support — for example, to mediate access to their deployment context, discover and interact with other agents, or shape their environment to better suit their design goals, including <i>Embodiment</i> and <i>Transparency</i>.</p>
          </aside>

          <p class="def"><strong>Principle 2 (Single entry point)</strong>: Given a single entry URL into a Hypermedia MAS, agents should be able to discover the rest of the system and the means to participate in it by following hyperlinks.</p>

          <p>The core idea behind this second principle is to maximize the usage of hypermedia in order to minimize coupling within the MAS, which promotes <i>Discoverability</i> and <i>Evolvability</i>. This principle draws directly on the <i>Hypermedia As The Engine of Application State (HATEOAS)</i> constraint in REST [[FIELDING00]].</p>

          <!-- <p class="def"><strong>Principle 3 (Observability)</strong>: Resources of potential interest to agents should be observable using Web standards, enabling agents to selectively monitor and perceive relevant changes in their environment.</p> -->

          <p class="def"><strong>Principle 3 (Observability)</strong>: Agents should be able to selectively perceive relevant changes in their environment by monitoring resources of potential interest using Web standards.</p>

          This principle enables <i>Situatedness</i> and <i>Resource Monitoring</i>, and improves the <i>Scalability</i> of the overall Hypemedia MAS: selective perception allows agents to focus only on those parts of the distributed hypermedia environment that are relevant to their current tasks, enabling them to handle larger environments while reducing the load on the underlying hypermedia infrastructure.</p>

          <aside class="issue">
            <p>Two design goals from Section&nbsp;<a href="#design-goals">3.3.1</a> are not directly addressed by the above design principles: <i>Value Alignment</i> and <i>Security</i>. To be discussed.</p>
